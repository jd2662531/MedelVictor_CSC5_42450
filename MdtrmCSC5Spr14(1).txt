Note: Submit the Midterm to my RCC email account mark.lehr@rcc.edu
with the following subject:  LastName,FirstName - Midterm - 42450.

Submit the solutions/program in a zipped file.
Do the best you can and turn in as much as you can.  

Note:  I just want one program for the solution to all the problems 
that follow. The program should prompt the user for which problem 
solution to display. Use a do-while and switch construct somewhat
like the following for the display of the menu and the selection of
which problem to run.  Or you can use the last menu program I sent
you.  Whichever, you find easier.

	int inN;
        do{
         Menu();
         inN=getN();
         switch(inN){
          case 1:    problem1();break;
          case 2:    problem2();break;
          case 3:    problem3();break;
          case 4:    problem4();break;
          case 5:    problem5();break;
          case 6:    problem6();break;
          default:   def(inN);}
        }while(inN<7);

Note:  In addition, I included this menu program if you haven't already
looked at it.

1)  The first program should ask for the number of lines the
user wants to output then the display should scroll down that many 
lines with line number starting where col=row. (i.e., ->)

Flowchart and code this solution.
	

2)  One interesting application of computers is drawing graphs and 
bar charts (sometimes called "histograms"). Write an application that 
reads up to 5 numbers (each between 3 and 27). For each number entered, 
your program should draw a line containing that number of adjacent 
asterisks. For example, if your program reads the number seven, it 
should print *******.  


3)  Develop an application that will determine if a bank customer 
has exceeded his checking account. The following 
facts are available and input into the program:

a. Account number (Six digits only)
b. Balance at the beginning of the month 
c. Total of all checks written by this customer this month 
d. Total of all deposits credited to this customer's account this 
     month.

The program should input each of these facts as 
unsigned shorts, calculate the new balance, display the new balance and 
debit the account $12.50 if overdrawn. Also, if overdrawn, tell the 
customer an additional $12.50 fee has been accessed and what the 
balance whould be with this fee included.


4)  Develop an application that will determine the gross pay for 
employees. The company pays "straight-time" for the 
first 20 hours worked, time and a half for all hours worked in 
excess of 20 hours but less than 40 hours, and double time for any 
hours worked over 40 hours. Inputs to the program would be hours
worked and rate of pay.  Output would be gross pay.

5) An ISP has 3 different subscription packages
	a)  $29.95 per month, 11 hours access.  Additional hours
	    are $2.25 up to 22 hours then $4.95 for all additional
		hours.
	b)  $34.95 per month, 22 hours access.  Additional hours
        are $1.25 up to 33 hours then $2.25 for each
		hour above this limit.
	c)  $42.95 per month unlimited access
Write a program that calculates a customers monthly bill.  Ask which
package how many hours then display the monthly charge.

6)  Just another sequence, The Funny Sequence

Funny numbers are numbers whose only prime factors are 2, 3 or 5. The sequence
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, ...
shows the first 11 funny numbers. By convention, 1 is included.
Write a program to find and print the 1475'th funny/ugly number.
Input and Output
There is no input to this program. Output should consist of a single line as shown below, 
with <number> replaced by the number computed.
Sample output
The 1475'th ugly number is <number>. 
A flowchart is required with the solution of this problem.
